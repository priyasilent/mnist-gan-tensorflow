# MNIST GAN with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow 2.

## 🔧 Features
- Generator and Discriminator models from scratch
- Trains on handwritten digit images (MNIST)
- Produces synthetic digit images from random noise

## 🚀 How to Run
You can either run this in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or locally with Jupyter.

### ▶️ Run in Colab
Just upload the notebook and run all cells.

### 🖥 Run Locally

Run the following commands:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    jupyter notebook MNIST_GAN_Image_Generation_with_TensorFlow.ipynb

## 🧪 Requirements
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📷 Example Output
After each epoch, the model will display generated handwritten digits from noise.
